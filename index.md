# Welcome

I am currently using this as a repository of links to useful information.
* [Index formatter repo](https://github.com/byjosh/index_formatter) - useful if you happen to be on a course where you have to create an index of the books. Other apps such as [Voltaire](https://voltaire.publickey.io/) are available but I initially wanted two A5 pages per A4 sheet and some formatting & flow options easily available in HTML - so rather ignored the issue of other apps and went from having a spreadsheet to writing myself a CSV to HTML formatter. I then added features like the ability to deal with tags (generating extra entries prepended by the tags found in a column containing a comma separated taglist), docx export, and CSV export - the last good for pruning the output if tags add a few too many extra entries). So if I have reinvented the wheel I doubt my wheel lacks features.
* [Programming books available online](/programming-ebooks-online)
* [Some charts I did in R - plotting age-standardised mortality rate by vaccination status](/asmr-by-vaccination-status) - done in context of COVID-19 pandemic & vaccination against it (the kind of charts one needs to avoid <a class="external" href="https://covidactuaries.org/2021/11/22/simpsons-paradox-and-vaccines/" target="_blank">falling for Simpson's Paradox</a> in this context).
