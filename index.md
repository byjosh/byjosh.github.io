# Welcome

I am currently using this as a repository of links to useful information.

## IT & programming related
* [Index formatter repo](https://github.com/byjosh/index_formatter) - useful if you happen to be on a course where you have to create an index of the books. Other apps such as [Voltaire](https://voltaire.publickey.io/) are available but I initially wanted two A5 pages per A4 sheet and some formatting & flow options easily available in HTML - so rather ignored the issue of other apps and went from having a spreadsheet to writing myself a CSV to HTML formatter. I then added features like the ability to deal with tags (generating extra entries prepended by the tags found in a column containing a comma separated taglist), docx export, and CSV export - the last good for pruning the output if tags add a few too many extra entries). So if I have reinvented the wheel I doubt my wheel lacks features.
* [Programming books available online](/programming-ebooks-online)
* [Some charts I did in R - plotting age-standardised mortality rate by vaccination status](/asmr-by-vaccination-status) - done in context of COVID-19 pandemic & vaccination against it (the kind of charts one needs to avoid <a class="external" href="https://covidactuaries.org/2021/11/22/simpsons-paradox-and-vaccines/" >falling for Simpson's Paradox</a> in this context).
* [ESP32 analogue to digital (ADC) issue encountered in MicroPython & solution](/esp32-adc-micropython-issue)


## Pandemic related
* [Pandemic scientific papers](/pandemic-scientific-papers) 
* [Some charts I did in R - plotting age-standardised mortality rate by vaccination status](/asmr-by-vaccination-status) - done in context of COVID-19 pandemic & vaccination against it (the kind of charts one needs to avoid <a class="external" href="https://covidactuaries.org/2021/11/22/simpsons-paradox-and-vaccines/" >falling for Simpson's Paradox</a> in this context).

## Ideas and statistics 
* [Key skills stats](/oecd-skills-stats) - England could do much better on levels of adult literacy (for the older generations who grew up rich compared to much of the world England does OK but could do better for the younger generations).
